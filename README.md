my protogen arduino project
I use 8x8 leds matrix with max72191 and an arduino, and a HC-06 for include bluetooth. You can make an application with MIT app inventor for control your arduino with bluetooth.



led matrix connections :

vcc -> 5v

gnd -> gnd

din -> 12

cs -> 11

clk -> 10


HC-06 connection : 

rxd -> 3
txd -> 2
gnd -> gnd
vcc -> 3.3v

/!\You need The LedControl library, don't forget to install it /!\
